# Introduction
This is my first SQL project, where I  have tried to get the idea of the job market! I have majorly focused on Data Analyst roles. This project explores top-paying jobs, top-paying skills, top-demanded skills, top-paying skills & lastly the optimal skills(Ones which have high demand & also provide high pay) in Data Analytics.

Check-out the SQL queries here: [project_sql folder](/project_sql/)

# Background
I wanted to make this project to apply whatever I have learned so far in SQL. This project aims to find out the kind of jobs to look out for if you are into Data Analytics, the kind of skills to learn, what skills are in demand and how much they pay on an average.

The datasets used are from [SQL Course by 
Luke Barousse](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql)

### The questions which I wanted to answer:-
1. What are the top paying data-analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data-analytics?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimum skills to learn?
# Tools used
- **SQL**: All of my queries are in SQL, it allowed me to get sharp insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: This was my database management system.
- **Visual Studio Code**: It doesn't need to be explined, it's the go-to text-editor.
- **Git & Github**: Essential for version control & sharing my SQL scripts & analysis, ensuring collboration & project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query provides insights at specific aspects of the data-analyst job market.

### 1. Top paying Data Analysis jobs
I identified the high paying jobs in India for data analysis by filtering the data by the job title, job location & salary year average columns.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN
    company_dim
ON
    job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location LIKE '%India' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```

Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:-

- **Wide Salary Range**: Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.
```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,

        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN
        company_dim
    ON
        job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location LIKE '%India' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills_dim.skills
FROM
    top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN
    skills_job_dim
ON
    top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN
    skills_dim
ON
    skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
```

### 4. Skills Based on Salary
Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills, revealed which skills are the highest paying.
```sql
SELECT 
    skills_dim.skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary_per_annum
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
